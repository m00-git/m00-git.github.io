<h2 id="title">Journey of Starting My Colleges Cybersecurity Club</h2>
<p>When I got to my College there was no Cybersecurity club! Which was<br />
a little surprising despite it being as new of a school as it was. There<br />
was a Programming Club and plenty of other student orgs so it was<br />
just a little strange. So if theres no club to participate in I guess I had<br />
to start one. This will be a little entry documenting the things Ive learned<br />
through that journey.</p>
<h3 id="it-begins">It begins</h3>
<p>The goals of the club was to provide a fun learning environment where<br />
students can show up every week and learn new security concepts and<br />
do so in a fun and hands on way. Since we had NO budget or equipment<br />
available that ‘hands on’ method would have to be virtualized. We used<br />
the learning platform TryHackMe to provide us plenty of free materials<br />
and virtual labs, and it also introduced all members to a great platform<br />
to continue their learning on their own time.</p>
<p>A website was made using githubs static page feature. Which you can<br />
find at <a href="fpu-cc.github.io">fpu-cc.github.io</a>. This documented future meetings and materials<br />
needed to participate in the lab portion of meetings. (Kali Linux + THM<br />
account). Instructions were made to make it easy as possible for noobs<br />
to get started. Guiding people how to set up a kali linux virtual machine<br />
so they could participate in meetings.</p>
<p>I advertised each meeting with themed flyers. Placed wherever flyers<br />
were allowed. The ASCII art flyers also helped to give us a distinct<br />
theme and style. I also made sure that each flyer told readers to setup<br />
their hacking environment before attending.<br />
<img src="flyer.png" /></p>
<p>A little suprising to me was most members never even <em>used</em> linux<br />
before at all. And many came without setting up their virtual machine.<br />
As a solution, going forward I brought 4 USB thumbdrives that had all<br />
of the necessary software and files, so unprepared members could just<br />
copy them to their computer and get started in 5 minutes, instead of<br />
having to download the .ova and virtualbox, which was taking a long<br />
time on the open wifi.</p>
<p>Just as things were taking off though…</p>
<h3 id="covid-obstacles">COVID Obstacles</h3>
<p>COVID completely halted the SP2020 semester. Clubs were no longer<br />
able to meet in person and our classes moved to online. Attempts were<br />
made to continue meetings online but <em>no one</em> showed up. So the club<br />
stagnated for the rest of the Spring semester with plans to return in the<br />
fall. So our story continues in FA2020.</p>
<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>
<p>Before the club can be officially acknowledged by the college we had to<br />
have a steady attendance of 15 members across 4 different meetings.<br />
As the school is small this was a little hard. The College also had rules<br />
against leaving flyers around. Theres dedicated ‘flyer spots’ but from<br />
experience I knew those were mostly ignored. So to get our name out<br />
there, during the first week of FA2020 I printed 150 flyers and completely<br />
flyer bombed the school. I also <span class="citation" data-cites="everyoned">@everyoned</span> across all the student<br />
discords I could find. A couple days afterwards I got an email from<br />
faculty to not place flyers, but it was definitely worth it. In that one<br />
day the clubs membership more than doubled in size.</p>
<h3 id="make-it-online">Make it Online</h3>
<p>After a few months of COVID19 living members were more ready to<br />
attend online meetings, and in fact meeting online played to our<br />
advantage as it made it much easier for members to attend. Within the<br />
first month we were able to meet the attendance requirements and then<br />
began the long and tedious process of paperwork. But we got official.</p>
