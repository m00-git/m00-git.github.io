## Title
When I got to my College there was no Cybersecurity club! Which was  
a little surprising despite it being as new of a school as it was. There  
was a Programming Club and plenty of other student orgs so it was  
just a little strange. So if theres no club to participate in I guess I had  
to start one. This will be a little entry documenting the things Ive learned  
through that journey.  

### It begins
The goals of the club was to provide a fun learning environment where  
students can show up every week and learn new security concepts and  
do so in a fun and hands on way. Since we had NO budget or equipment  
available that 'hands on' method would have to be virtualized. We used  
the learning platform TryHackMe to provide us plenty of free materials  
and virtual labs, and it also introduced all members to a great platform  
to continue their learning on their own time.  

A website was made using githubs static page feature. Which you can  
find at  [fpu-cc.github.io](fpu-cc.github.io).  This documented future meetings and materials  
needed to participate in the lab portion of meetings. (Kali Linux + THM  
account). Instructions were made to make it easy as possible for noobs  
to get started. Guiding people how to set up a kali linux virtual machine  
so they could participate in meetings.

I advertised each meeting with themed flyers. Placed wherever flyers  
were allowed. The ASCII art flyers also helped to give us a distinct  
 theme and style. I also made sure that each flyer told readers to setup  
their hacking environment before attending.

A little suprising to me was most members never even *used* linux  
before at all. And many came without setting up their virtual machine.  
As a solution, going forward I brought 4 USB thumbdrives that had all  
of the necessary software and files, so unprepared members could just  
copy them to their computer and get started in 5 minutes, instead of  
having to download the .ova and virtualbox, which was taking a long  
time on the open wifi.

Just as things were taking off though...  

### COVID Obstacles
COVID completely halted the SP2020 semester. Clubs were no longer  
able to meet in person and our classes moved to online. Attempts were  
made to continue meetings online but *no one* showed up. So the club  
stagnated for the rest of the Spring semester with plans to return in the  
fall. So our story continues in FA2020.

### Advertising
Before the club can be officially acknowledged by the college we had to  
have a steady attendance of 15 members across 4 different meetings.  
As the school is small this was a little hard. The College also had rules  
against leaving flyers around. Theres dedicated 'flyer spots' but from  
experience I knew those were mostly ignored. So to get our name out  
there, during the first week of FA2020 I printed 150 flyers and completely  
flyer bombed the school. I also @everyoned across all the student  
discords I could find. A couple days afterwards I got an email from  
faculty to not place flyers, but it was definitely worth it. In that one  
day the clubs membership more than doubled in size. 

### Make it Online
After a few months of COVID19 living members were more ready to  
attend online meetings, and in fact meeting online played to our  
advantage as it made it much easier for members to attend. Within the  
first month we were able to meet the attendance requirements and then  
began the long and tedious process of paperwork. But we got official.
