<h2 id="tryhackme-brute-it-writeup">TryHackMe Brute It Writeup</h2>
<p><a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/bruteit">This</a> isn’t a particularly difficult room but I didn’t see any writeups<br>
currently made for it, (or at least accepted) so I decided to make one.<br />
Also because I havent done any writeups before and this seemed like<br />
a good place to start.</p>
<h3 id="reconnaissance">Reconnaissance</h3>
<p>First I started with a service scan with nmap<br />
<img src="nmapoutput.png" /><br />
we see that ssh and apache are the only things running, this is a very<br />
simple web server. Now lets bruteforce the web directories with gobuster.<br />
<img src="gobusteroutput.png" /><br />
The output we get shows a <code>/admin</code> directory that we can acess and also<br />
a <code>/server-status</code> directory that we cant access.<br />
<img src="loginform.png" /><br />
Upon viewing the <code>/admin</code> we get a login portal. Lets also check the html.<br />
<img src="login-inspected.png" /><br />
Upon viewing the source html we also see a comment addressed to a<br />
john letting us know that the login username is admin.</p>
<h3 id="getting-user-access">Getting User Access</h3>
<p>Were going to have to bruteforce this login page, so lets make a more<br />
efficient wordlist. Since we know the password is going to be 6 characters<br />
long I filter the rockyou.txt wordlist to only contain passwords that are 6<br />
characters long. This will save us time on the actual bruteforcing<br />
process.</p>
<p><code>cat rockyou.txt | grep -x '.\{6,6\}' &gt; 6rock.txt</code></p>
<p>Now, Im going to use OWASP ZAP to bruteforce this login form as I find<br />
working with hydra clunky and unreliable. If you arent familiar with<br />
OWASP ZAP you can check out the very good TryHackMe room on it <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/learnowaspzap">here</a></p>
<p>After you get ZAP running and intercepting traffic, make a test login, I<br />
used the credentials admin:secret. Then in zap find that login request and<br />
fuzz it.<br />
<img src="about2fuzz.png" /><br />
then select the text that you want to be changed for every request, which<br />
is going to be the password input. Then add the altered rockyou wordlist<br />
as the payload.<br />
<img src="zap-fuzzer.png" /><br />
It doesnt take too long for ZAP to find the password. Only 222 requests.<br />
Sort the results by “code” in descending order so that when theres a<br />
successful login its the first one.<br />
<img src="zap-fuzzd.png" /><br />
Using the found credentials we can login to the admin page. Where we<br />
will find our web flag and an RSA Private Key for the user john.<br />
<img src="adminlogged.png" /><br />
At first I didnt know how to crack this key with john, but a quick google<br />
search with for “crack Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED DEK-Info: AES-128” gave<br />
me this <a href="https://sql--injection.blogspot.com/p/decrypt-ssh-keys.html">blog post</a> which detailed the steps required.<br />
First we’ll need a python script to convert this key to something readable<br />
by John the Ripper. As ssh2john didnt work with my jumbo version of john<br />
I had to download a <a href="githubusercontent.com/stricture/hashstack-server-plugin-jtr/master/scrapers/sshng2john.py">python script</a> that would.<br />
then run the script with <code>python3 sshng2john.py id_rsa &gt; crackme</code><br />
Theres some garbage data thats placed on the first line, go ahead and<br />
manually delete it. The hash file to be used by john should only be one<br />
line long. Your final output should look similar to this.<br />
<img src="crackmeoutput.png" /><br />
Then we can go ahead and crack this hash with John<br />
<img src="cracked.png" /><br />
Now that we have our ssh user and password lets login.<br />
<img src="ssherror.png" /><br />
I initially got an error but another quick google search got me the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29933918/ssh-key-permissions-0644-for-id-rsa-pub-are-too-open-on-mac">answer</a><br />
I needed. I had to change the rsa.key permissions with<br />
<code>chmod 400 rsa.key</code><br />
After changing the permissions I was able to login just fine and get the<br />
user flag.<br />
<img src="user.png" /></p>
<h3 id="getting-root-access">Getting Root Access</h3>
<p>The first thing I did was check for sudoable programs with<br />
<code>sudo -l</code> and from there I saw that we could run <code>cat</code> with root access.<br />
So then I just got the root flag with <code>sudo cat /root/root.txt</code><br />
<img src="root.png" /><br />
But we also need the root password. So lets get the linux hashes and crack<br />
them. <code>sudo cat /etc/shadow</code> and <code>sudo cat /etc/passwd</code> and save the<br />
outputs to files on your own machine (can just copy and paste from the<br />
terminal). I saved mine as <code>shadow</code> and <code>passwd</code> respectively. Then<br />
prepare the hashes for john with<br />
<code>unshadow passwd shadow &gt; linuxhash</code><br />
and then we can crack with john<br />
<img src="roothash.png" /></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This was an easy but fun little room. It was actually the first CTF that<br />
I’ve done where you’ve been required to crack linux user hashes which was<br />
nice.</p>
